                        Corona(COVID-19) turned out to be a great pandemic
                        through out the world.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
                        is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
                        coronavirus.Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus
                        will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and 
                        recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people,
                        and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular
                        disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer
                            are more likely to develop serious illness.

                        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well
                        informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and
                        how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by 
                        washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently
                        and not touching your face. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva
                        or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or
                        sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory 
                        etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for 
                        COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials
                        evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide 
                        updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.

                    Kerala has launched a 'break the chain' campaign to fend off 
                    the Covid-19 spread, in the wake of a second wave of infections
                     after a virus carrier family returning from Italy had created
                      a cluster in Pathanamthitta district.
